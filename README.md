# 🚀 Large File Ingestion and Processing Benchmark

This project explores efficient techniques for reading and processing a large CSV dataset using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Dask**, and **Modin**. The file used is a sample of NYC Yellow Taxi trip data.

---
Task:
Take any csv/text file of 2+ GB of your choice. --- (You can do this assignment on Google colab)

Read the file ( Present approach of reading the file )

Try different methods of file reading eg: Dask, Modin, Ray, pandas and present your findings in term of computational efficiency

Perform basic validation on data columns : eg: remove special character , white spaces from the col name

As you already know the schema hence create a YAML file and write the column name in YAML file. --define separator of
read and write file, column name in YAML

Validate number of columns and column name of ingested file with YAML.

Write the file in pipe separated text file (|) in gz format.

Create a summary of the file:

Total number of rows,

total number of columns

file size

## 📌 Objectives

- Compare file reading performance using different Python libraries
- Perform basic data cleaning on column names
- Define schema using YAML and validate against the ingested file
- Export the cleaned data to a compressed format with custom delimiter
- Generate file summary including row count, column count, and size

## 📂 Dataset

- 📁 File: `yellow-tripdata-2025-01.csv`
- 📦 Source: [NYC TLC Trip Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
- 🧮 Size: ~375MB
- 🔢 Rows: 3.47 million+
- 📊 Columns: 19

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- `pandas`
- `dask`
- `modin` (with `ray`)
- `pyyaml`
- `gzip`
- `Google Colab` for execution

## 🚀 File Reading Benchmark

| **Library** | **Read Time (s)** | **Notes** |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Pandas      | 16.58             | Simple and reliable, but slower |
| Dask        | 2.67              | Fastest using lazy and parallel evaluation |
| Modin       | 38.72             | Overhead due to Ray + Colab's memory limits |

> ✅ **Dask** outperformed the rest for large-scale ingestion in this setup.

---

## 🧹 Column Cleaning

Cleaned column names by:
- Stripping leading/trailing whitespace
- Replacing special characters with `_` using regex

```python
def clean_columns(df):
    df.columns = [re.sub(r'\W+', '_', col.strip()) for col in df.columns]
    return df
